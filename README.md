# hello-world

Yes yes, my first branch. I'll be trying my best to learn git, all the clicking exhausts me so ill try gitting from the terminal.

My name's Tom, I'm level 22, I like trains.
I study Computer Science at the Technical University of Ostrava.

My favourite language is C++, but i've coded in Python and C# aswell.
I'll be commiting mostly simple projects here.
